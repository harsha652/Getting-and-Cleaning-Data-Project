# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
The repository contains  the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The data is taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## Details of the Scripts

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
